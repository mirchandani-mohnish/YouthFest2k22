The official repository of the cultural festival of Ahmedabad University. 

## About YouthFest 2022
The Youth Fest is a vibrant platform for students of the University to showcase their talent, to sharpen their skills, to creatively express themselves, to mingle, to collaborate and of course to build lifelong memories. The Youth Fest is back with a bang this year, and we have some very exciting news!<br />
We are delighted to announce the theme of Youth Fest 2022, which is: "India Recalled" With this theme, we at Ahmedabad University wish to go back to our roots, our traditions and revisit our culture. There is a lot to learn from our own history; from ancient civilisations to post- independence era. The diversity in our culture gives us the opportunity to explore both; traditional and contemporary knowledge systems.
